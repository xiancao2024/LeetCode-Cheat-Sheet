- **378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix**
- **75. Sort Colors**
- **Merge Intervals**

### 2. Two Pointers (Linked Lists)
Involves problems where two pointers or a two-pointer technique is used to solve linked list problems.
- **21. Merge Two Sorted Lists**
- **19. Remove Nth Node From End of List**

### Greedy Two-Pointer
Typically involves optimizing a value while managing two criteria simultaneously with a sorted array.
- **948. Bag of Tokens**
  - **Characteristics**: Maximization/Minimization, Sorted Input, Dynamic Adjustment, Resource Management.

### 3. Brute Force/Backtracking
Suitable for problems where constraints are small and brute force is fast enough.
- **Permutations**
- **Subset**
- **Letter Combinations of a Phone Number**
- **Generate Parentheses**
- **N-Queens**

### 4. Dynamic Programming (Small Constraint Bounds)
Used when brute force is too slow, but constraints are small.
- **House Robber**
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence**
- **Unique Paths**
- **Partition Equal Subset Sum**
- **Longest Palindromic Substring**

### 5. Prefix Sums
Deals with problems involving subarrays or substrings with sums or additive operations.
- **Subarray Sum Equals K**
- **Find Pivot Index**
- **Range Sum Query - Immutable**
- **Maximum Sum of Two Non-Overlapping Subarrays**
- **Continuous Subarray Sum**

### 6. Sliding Window
Involves problems with subarrays or substrings where the sliding window technique is used but does not involve additive sums.
- **Minimum Size Subarray Sum**
- **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
- **Sliding Window Maximum**
- **Longest Repeating Character Replacement**
- **Fruit Into Baskets**

### 7. Binary Search (Monotonic Condition)
Used for problems involving calculating max/min with a monotonic condition.
- **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**
- **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**
- **Median of Two Sorted Arrays**
- **Find Peak Element**
- **H-Index II**

### 8. Dynamic Programming (Non-Monotonic Condition)
For problems where dynamic programming is used to calculate max/min but without a monotonic condition.
- **Maximum Subarray**
- **Coin Change**
- **Longest Common Subsequence**
- **Minimum Path Sum**
- **Knapsack Problem**

### 9. Dynamic Programming (Splittable Sub-Problems)
For problems that can be split into smaller sub-problems.
- **Climbing Stairs**
- **Edit Distance**
- **Fibonacci Number**
- **0/1 Knapsack**
- **Longest Palindromic Subsequence**

### 10. Greedy Algorithms
Used when a problem can be solved with a greedy approach to calculate the answer.
- **Jump Game**
- **Gas Station**
- **Candy**
- **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II**
- **Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons**

### 11. Brute Force/Backtracking (Number of Ways)
For problems asking for the number of ways and brute force is efficient enough.
- **Combination Sum**
- **Letter Combinations of a Phone Number**
- **Palindrome Partitioning**
- **Word Search**
- **Combinations**

### 12. Dynamic Programming (Asking for Number of Ways)
Used when asking for the number of ways and brute force is not efficient enough.
- **Unique Paths**
- **Target Sum**
- **Coin Change 2**
- **Combination Sum IV**
- **Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence**
